"""Liam and his friends are sharing the cost of a group purchase. The total cost of the purchase is subject to a 10% discount. One of the friends receives a 35% bonus, which means they will pay a larger portion of the discounted cost. The remaining cost is then divided equally among the other friends.



Write a program to:



Calculate the total cost after applying a 10% discount.
Determine the amount paid by the friend who receives a 35% bonus.
Calculate the amount each of the other friends will pay.
Input format :
The first line of input consists of a float value f, representing the total cost.

The second line contains an integer value n, representing the total number of friends.

Output format :
The first line of output displays "Cost after a 10% discount: " followed by the discounted cost of the ticket package as a float value formatted to two decimal places.

The second line of output displays "Friend with a 35% bonus pays: " followed by the amount paid by the friend with the bonus as a float value formatted to two decimal places.

The third line of output displays "Each of the other friends pays: " followed by the individual share of the remaining cost as a float value formatted to two decimal places.
